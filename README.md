# Advent of Code 2025

Probably not the worst solutions, but definitely not the best.  
I already beat my previous record of 1 day in AoC lmao 🙏🙏

Feel free to open an issue if you want to scold me.

## Notes

### Day 1

Somewhat proud of myself of not just brute forcing. I may have found a better one while falling asleep (which I may implement if I have time).

### Day 2

Brute forcing🔥🔥🔥 :D

But at least I did it without operating on strings.

### Day 3

~~I think I did well in part 1~~. Then I looked at other solutions and realized it actually sucks.  
I left it as is, so you can see how bad it is.

Did part 2, and my solutions seems average, so I'm pretty happy with that.

### Day 4

Not too bad I think, the method I used in part 1 is apparently called "sliding window technique", which is probably a bit overkill for a 3x3 grid, but oh well.

I will not be doing part 2 (and possibly future days), since I've absolutely broke my sleeping schedule this week and other things have been piling up.

I still learned a few things and slowed the process of my brain rotting.
